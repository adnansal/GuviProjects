Object in Javascript :

Javascript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. 
An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
Object behaviour can be defined by methods. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. 
Object are real life things expressed in computer, like a car can be an object in javascript with characteristics 
as color of the car , model of the car , make year of the car and have behaviour as can start , car can be stopped , car can be accelarated.

Pattern of relating an object with its characteristics
objectName.propertyName


CODE : # 1 way
var myCar = new Object();
myCar.make = 'Ford';
myCar.model = 'Mustang';
myCar.year = 1969;

CODE: 2 Way
var myCar = {
    make: 'Ford',
    model: 'Mustang',
    year: 1969
};

Unassigned properties of an object are undefined.

Creating new objects :

JavaScript has a number of predefined objects. In addition, you can create your own objects. You can create an object using an object initializer. 
Alternatively, you can first create a constructor function and then instantiate an object invoking that function in conjunction with the new operator.
